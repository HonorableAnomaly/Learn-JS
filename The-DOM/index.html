Since launch, <i>World of Warcraft</i> has had eight major <a href="/wiki/Expansion_packs" class="mw-redirect" title="Expansion packs">expansion packs</a>: <i><a href="/wiki/The_Burning_Crusade" class="mw-redirect" title="The Burning Crusade">The Burning Crusade</a></i> (2007), <i><a href="/wiki/Wrath_of_the_Lich_King" class="mw-redirect" title="Wrath of the Lich King">Wrath of the Lich King</a></i> (2008), <i><a href="/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm" title="World of Warcraft: Cataclysm">Cataclysm</a></i> (2010), <i><a href="/wiki/Mists_of_Pandaria" class="mw-redirect" title="Mists of Pandaria">Mists of Pandaria</a></i> (2012), <i><a href="/wiki/Warlords_of_Draenor" class="mw-redirect" title="Warlords of Draenor">Warlords of Draenor</a></i> (2014), <i><a href="/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion" title="World of Warcraft: Legion">Legion</a></i> (2016), <i><a href="/wiki/Battle_for_Azeroth" class="mw-redirect" title="Battle for Azeroth">Battle for Azeroth</a></i> (2018), and <i><a href="/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Shadowlands" title="World of Warcraft: Shadowlands">Shadowlands</a></i> (2020).
        </p><p>Similar to other MMORPGs, the game allows players to create a <a href="/wiki/Player_character" title="Player character">character</a> <a href="/wiki/Avatar_(computing)" title="Avatar (computing)">avatar</a> and explore an <a href="/wiki/Open_world" title="Open world">open game world</a> in <a href="/wiki/Third-person_(video_games)" class="mw-redirect" title="Third-person (video games)">third</a>- or <a href="/wiki/First-person_(video_games)" title="First-person (video games)">first-person</a> view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing <a href="/wiki/Quest_(video_games)" title="Quest (video games)">quests</a>, and interacting with <a href="/wiki/Non-player_character" title="Non-player character">non-player characters</a> (NPCs) or other players. The game encourages players to work together to complete quests, enter dungeons and engage in <a href="/wiki/Player_versus_player" title="Player versus player">player versus player (PvP)</a> combat, however the game can also be played solo without interacting with others. The game primarily focuses on character progression, in which players earn experience points to level up their character to make them more powerful and buy and sell items using in-game currency to acquire better equipment, among other game systems.

        <p>As with other MMORPGs, players control a <a href="/wiki/Player_character" title="Player character">character</a> <a href="/wiki/Avatar_(computing)" title="Avatar (computing)">avatar</a> within a game world in <a href="/wiki/Third-person_(video_games)" class="mw-redirect" title="Third-person (video games)">third</a>- or <a href="/wiki/First-person_(video_games)" title="First-person (video games)">first-person</a> view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with <a href="/wiki/Non-player_character" title="Non-player character">non-player characters</a> (NPCs) or other players. Also similar to other MMORPGs, <i>World of Warcraft</i> requires the player to pay for a <a href="/wiki/Online_pay_for_play" class="mw-redirect" title="Online pay for play">subscription</a> by using a credit or debit card, using <a href="/wiki/Prepayment_for_service" title="Prepayment for service">prepaid</a> Blizzard game cards or using a WoW Token purchased <a href="/wiki/In-game" class="mw-redirect" title="In-game">in-game</a>. Players without a subscription may use a trial account that lets the player character reach up to level 20 but has many features locked.<sup id="cite_ref-gamespot_review_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gamespot_review-12">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
        </p><p>To enter the game, the player must select a <a href="/wiki/Game_server" title="Game server">server</a>, referred to in-game as a 'realm'. Each realm acts as an individual copy of the game world and falls into one of two categories. Available realms types are:
        </p>
        <ul><li>Normal – a regular type realm where the gameplay is mostly focused on defeating monsters and completing <a href="/wiki/Quest_(gaming)" class="mw-redirect" title="Quest (gaming)">quests</a>, with player-versus-player fights and any <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_game" title="Role-playing game">roleplay</a> are optional.</li>
        <li>RP (<a href="/wiki/Role-playing_game" title="Role-playing game">roleplay</a>) – which works the same way as a "Normal" realm, but focuses on players roleplaying in-character.</li></ul>
        <p>Before the introduction of World of Warcraft's seventh expansion "Battle for Azeroth", both "Normal" and "RP" servers were each divided into two separate categories: <a href="/wiki/Player_versus_environment" title="Player versus environment">PvE</a> servers and <a href="/wiki/Player_versus_player" title="Player versus player">PvP</a> servers. This has since been removed after the implementation of the "War Mode" option, which allows any player (of level 20 and higher) on any server to determine whether they want to actively participate in PvP combat or not, by enabling War Mode in two of the game's capital cities.
        </p><p>Realms are also categorized by language, with in-game support in the language available.<sup id="cite_ref-realm_types_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-realm_types-13">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
        </p><p>Players can make new characters on all realms within the region, and it is also possible to move already established characters between realms for a fee.<sup id="cite_ref-gamespot_realm_xfer_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gamespot_realm_xfer-14">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>

        <p>To create a new character, in keeping with the storyline of previous <i><a href="/wiki/Warcraft" title="Warcraft">Warcraft</a></i> games, players must choose between the opposing factions of the Alliance or the Horde; Pandaren, which were added in <i><a href="/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Mists_of_Pandaria" title="World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria">Mists of Pandaria</a></i>, do not commit to a faction until after the starting zone is completed. Characters from the opposing factions can perform rudimentary communication (most often just "emotes"), but only members of the same faction can speak, mail, group and join guilds. The player selects the new character's <a href="/wiki/Race_(fantasy)#Sentient_&quot;races&quot;" class="mw-redirect" title="Race (fantasy)">race</a>, such as orcs or trolls for the Horde, or humans or dwarves for the Alliance.<sup id="cite_ref-races_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-races-15">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Players must select the <a href="/wiki/Character_class" title="Character class">class</a> for the character, with choices such as mages, warriors, and priests available.<sup id="cite_ref-classes_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-classes-16">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Most classes are limited to particular races.

Items that have degraded heavily become unusable until they are repaired. If the location of the character's body is unreachable, they can use a special "spirit healer" NPC to resurrect at the graveyard. When the spirit healer revives a character, items equipped by the character at that time are further degraded, and the character is significantly weakened by what is in-game called "resurrection sickness" for up to ten minutes, depending on the character's level.

PvE (called normal or RP) servers, by contrast, allow a player to choose whether or not to engage in combat against other players. On both server types, there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted. Battlegrounds, for example, are similar to dungeons: only a set number of characters can enter a single battleground, but additional copies of the battleground can be made to accommodate additional players.<sup id="cite_ref-gamespot_1.5_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gamespot_1.5-28">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> Each battleground has a set objective, such as capturing a flag or defeating an opposing general, that must be completed to win the battleground. Competing in battlegrounds rewards the character with tokens and honor points that can be used to buy armor, weapons, and other general items that can aid a player in many areas of the game. Winning a battleground awards more honor and tokens than losing. In addition, players also earn honor when they or nearby teammates kill players in a battleground.<sup id="cite_ref-gamespot_1.4_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gamespot_1.4-27">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>

        </p><p><i>World of Warcraft</i> takes place in a <a href="/wiki/Three-dimensional_space" title="Three-dimensional space">3D</a> representation of the <i>Warcraft</i> universe that players can interact with through their characters. The game world initially consisted of the two continents in Azeroth: Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. Four separate expansions later added to the game's playable area the realms of Outland and Draenor and the continents of Northrend and Pandaria. As a player explores new locations, different routes and means of transportation become available. Players can access "flight masters" in newly discovered locations to fly to previously discovered locations in other parts of the world.<sup id="cite_ref-gamespot_1.10_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gamespot_1.10-29">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Players can also use boats, zeppelins, or portals to move from one continent to another. Although the game world remains relatively similar from day to day, seasonal events reflecting real world events, such as Halloween (Hallow's End),<sup id="cite_ref-gamespot_1.8_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gamespot_1.8-30">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Christmas (Winter Veil), Children's Week,<sup id="cite_ref-gamespot_1.4_27-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gamespot_1.4-27">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> Easter (Noblegarden), and Midsummer have been represented in the game world.

        </p><p>A number of facilities are available for characters while in towns and cities. In each major city, characters can access a bank to deposit items, such as treasure or crafted items. Each character has access to personal bank storage with the option to purchase additional storage space using in-game gold.<sup id="cite_ref-gamespot_bank_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gamespot_bank-31">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> Additionally, guild banks are available for use by members of a guild with restrictions being set by the guild leader.<sup id="cite_ref-WoW_Guild_Banks_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WoW_Guild_Banks-32">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> Auction houses are available for players to buy and sell items to others in a similar way to online auction sites such as <a href="/wiki/EBay" title="EBay">eBay</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-gamespot_ah_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gamespot_ah-33">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Players can use mailboxes, which can be found in almost every town.

        </p><p>Some of the challenges in <i>World of Warcraft</i> require players to group together to complete them. These usually take place in dungeons—also known as "instances"—that a group of characters can enter together.

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subscription">Subscription</span></h3>
        <p><i>World of Warcraft</i> requires a subscription to allow continued play, with options to pay in one-month, three-month, or six-month blocks, and time cards of varying lengths available from retailers, or purchasing a "WoW Token" in-game.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-bbcsubs_38-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bbcsubs-38">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> Expansion packs are available online and from retailers. As the game client is the same regardless of the version of <i>World of Warcraft</i> the user owns, the option to purchase expansions online was added as it allows for a quick upgrade. <i>World of Warcraft</i> is also available as a free Starter Edition, which is free to play for an unlimited amount of time. Starter Edition characters are unable to gain experience after reaching level 20, and there are other restrictions in effect for Starter Edition accounts, including the inability to trade, use mail, use Auction House, use public chat channels, join guilds or amass more than ten gold.<sup id="cite_ref-gs-starter_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gs-starter-39">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>
        </p><p>In January 2015, accounts that have lapsed subscriptions, which previously would not let a player log in, work like a restricted Starter Edition account with the one difference that sub-level 20 characters will be able to join a guild if any of your other characters are still in that guild.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>
        </p><p>In April 2015, an alternate way to cover the subscription was introduced. A player may spend real money ($20 in North America and differing amounts in other regions) on a WoW Token, which is sold on the auction house for in-game gold that initially could only be used to add 30 days of playtime.<sup id="cite_ref-bbcsubs_38-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bbcsubs-38">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> At the launch of the feature in NA, a token sold for 30k gold and 24 hours later sold for 20k gold, therefore the gold amount changes depending on what players are willing to spend and the supply. Subsequently, the amount that an NA token sells for remained selling at above 30,000 gold and the other Battle.net regions are well above that value. Once a player buys a token on the auction house, it is account bound and cannot be resold. As of February 2017, the WoW Token can also be exchanged for $15 in Battle.net balance that can be used as credit for purchases in most of Blizzard's games as well as in <i><a href="/wiki/Destiny_2" title="Destiny 2">Destiny 2</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup>

It is possible to set a daily limit, a weekly limit, or to specify an allowed playing schedule.

But something far more sinister lurked behind Ahn'Qiraj's walls: the Old God C'Thun, an ancient entity whose pervasive evil had suffused Azeroth since time immemorial. As C'Thun incited the qiraji to frenzy, both the Alliance and Horde prepared for a massive war effort. A mixed force of Alliance and Horde soldiers, dubbed the Might of Kalimdor, opened the gates of Ahn'Qiraj under the command of the orc Varok Saurfang.

        <p>The <i>World of Warcraft</i> launcher (referred to in press releases and the menu bar as the "Blizzard Launcher") is a program designed to act as a starting point for <i>World of Warcraft</i> players. It provides a way to launch <i>World of Warcraft</i> and starts the Blizzard updater. It was first included with the version 1.8.3 patch. The 2.1.0 patch allowed for an option to bypass the use of the launcher. Features of the launcher include news and updates for <i>World of Warcraft</i> players, access to <i>World of Warcraft</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&#39;</span>s support website, access to the test version of <i>World of Warcraft</i> when it is available to test upcoming patches, updates to <a href="/wiki/Warden_(software)" class="mw-redirect" title="Warden (software)">Warden</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-warden_updates_61-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-warden_updates-61">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> and updates to the updater itself. The 3.0.8 patch redesigned the launcher and added the ability to change the game settings from the launcher itself. The launcher update from patch 4.0.1 also allows people to play the game while non-crucial pieces of the game are downloaded. This requires a high-speed broadband internet connection.
        </p><p><a href="/wiki/Patch_(computing)" title="Patch (computing)">Patch</a> 1.9.3 added native support for <a href="/wiki/Apple%E2%80%93Intel_architecture" title="Apple–Intel architecture">Intel-powered Macs</a>, making <i>World of Warcraft</i> a <a href="/wiki/Universal_binary" title="Universal binary">universal application</a>. As a result of this, the minimum supported Mac OS X version has been changed to 10.3.9; <i>World of Warcraft</i> version 1.9.3 and later will not launch on older versions of Mac OS X.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/PowerPC" title="PowerPC">PowerPC</a> architecture Macs are no longer supported since version 4.0.1.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup>
        </p><p>When new content is added to the game, official system requirements may change. In version 1.12.0 the requirements for Windows were increased from requiring 256&#160;MB to 512&#160;MB of RAM. Official <a href="/wiki/Windows_98" title="Windows 98">Windows 98</a> technical support was dropped, but the game continued to run there until version 2.2.3.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> Before Mists of Pandaria in 2012, <i>World of Warcraft</i> officially dropped support for <a href="/wiki/Windows_2000" title="Windows 2000">Windows 2000</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> followed by <a href="/wiki/Windows_XP" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a> and <a href="/wiki/Windows_Vista" title="Windows Vista">Vista</a> in October 2017, as well as all 32-bit support.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup>

        <p>As with other <a href="/wiki/MMORPG" class="mw-redirect" title="MMORPG">MMORPGs</a>, companies have emerged offering to sell virtual gold and associated services.

        </p><p>In patch 2.1, Blizzard responded to this by adding additional anti-spam mechanics including whisper throttling and the report spam function. Additionally, trial accounts are prevented from speaking in the public chat channels (although they may speak to players within range or whisper to other players that have first whispered to them), participating in in-game trades, and using the Auction House and the mail feature, among other limitations.

        </p><p>As characters progress in <i>World of Warcraft</i> and take on some of the toughest challenges, many of the rewards received are bound to that character and cannot be traded, generating a market for the trading of accounts with well-equipped characters. The highest noted <i>World of Warcraft</i> account trade was for £5000 (€7000, US$9,900) in early September 2007. The high price was due to the character possessing items that at the time were owned by only a handful out of the millions of active players, due to the difficulty in acquiring them. However, Blizzard banned the account five days after the purchase.<sup id="cite_ref-zeuzo_145-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-zeuzo-145">&#91;144&#93;</a></sup>

        <p>The Corrupted Blood plague incident was one of the first events to affect entire servers. Patch 1.7 saw the opening of Zul'Gurub, the game's first 20-player raid dungeon where players faced off against a tribe of trolls. Upon engaging the final boss, players were stricken by a <a href="/wiki/Buff_(computer_gaming)#Debuffs" class="mw-redirect" title="Buff (computer gaming)">debuff</a> called "Corrupted Blood" which would periodically sap their life. The disease was passed on to other players simply by being near infected players. Originally this malady was confined within the Zul'Gurub instance, but it made its way into the outside world by way of hunter pets or warlock minions that contracted the disease.
        </p><p>Within hours, Corrupted Blood had completely infected major cities because of their high player concentrations. Low-level players were killed in seconds by the high-damage disease. Eventually, Blizzard fixed the issue so that the plague could not exist outside of Zul'Gurub.
        </p><p>The Corrupted Blood plague so closely resembled the <a href="/wiki/Outbreak" class="mw-redirect" title="Outbreak">outbreak</a> of real-world epidemics that scientists are currently looking at the ways MMORPGs or other massively distributed systems can model human behavior during outbreaks. The reaction of players to the plague closely resembled previously hard-to-model aspects of human behavior that may allow researchers to more accurately predict how diseases and outbreaks spread amongst a population.<sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">&#91;151&#93;</a></sup>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legacy">Legacy</span></h2>
        <p><i>World of Warcraft</i> redefined the MMORPG genre. Its innovations were not necessarily original in isolation, but together they created a model for the genre as a theme park rather than a simulation. Its environment had tonal variety with serious lore and full characters but the intention to entertain. The game used quest completion for experience progression, making gameplay into a shopping list and encouraging mobility rather than dominating a location. Its use of instanced dungeons let players progress together without running into others, such that different areas of the game had different purposes, separating places for group challenges, mass challenges, and leveling. <i>World of Warcraft</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&#39;s</span> original talent system, which let players distribute points among upgrades, saw wide adoption, including by <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic" title="Star Wars: The Old Republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></i>. <i>World of Warcraft</i> also gave structure to the "raid" group activity, in which players needed a specific strategy. Emergent behavior from raid strategies were later built into the game.<sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-153">&#91;152&#93;</a></sup>
        </p><p>While not the first MMORPG to lead to hundreds of hours of commitment, <i>World of Warcraft</i> was the most successful one in its time. "Most people", wrote <i><a href="/wiki/Vice_(website)" class="mw-redirect" title="Vice (website)">Vice</a></i> in 2019, "know someone who's said they were 'addicted' to <i>World of Warcraft</i>". For some, the game became a near-total obsession taking precedent over basic necessities and relationships. The game's bountiful quests provided a sense of purpose or coping mechanism for many who were unfulfilled with their lives, even though that time investment resulted in no change to their life fulfillment. The game inspired Wowaholics Anonymous, a community for players seeking to quit playing. <i>World of Warcraft</i> also provided hope and purpose to players, some leading to in-person romance.<sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-154">&#91;153&#93;</a></sup>
